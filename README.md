# sudoko-solver-CSP
A project done by me and team members to create a sudoko game by using A.I CSP
You have to run the GUI code to start the game, we have two backend files one for printing the arcs and domain while solving (main print)
and the other one wihtout any prints (main no print)
to get the prints you have to create text file output.log
